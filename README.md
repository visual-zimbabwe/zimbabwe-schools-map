# Zimbabwe Schools Map (Minimal)

This repo contains the Zimbabwe schools dataset and supporting notes for a minimalist web tool concept.

Current focus:
- Web v1.0: Map of Secondary Schools (Leaflet-based, static web app)

Key data:
- `location_of_schools.csv` (source dataset)
- `data/secondary_schools.geojson` (filtered, map-ready data)
- `data/secondary_schools.js` (embedded data for file-based loading)

How to run locally:
- Open `index.html` in a browser or serve a local static server.

Progress tracking:
- Update `PROGRESS.md` whenever changes are made to files, data, or plans.
